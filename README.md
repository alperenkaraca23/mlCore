# mlCore

<li> I did this small project as a training to be able to integrate it into larger projects later. </li>
<li> I designed my project basically as an artificial intelligence model that tells what the added photo is. </li>
<li> First, I learned how to integrate these ML models into my project by reading the Core ML documentation from developer.apple. </li>
<li> Then, I downloaded MobileNetV2, which is the most suitable one for my project among Apple's ready-made models, and integrated it into my project. </li>
<li> Finally, I designed the interface. I created a picker for the photo and a label for the results. I completed my project by adding the necessary codes. </li>
